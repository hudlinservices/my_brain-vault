# Innovatience

**Technical Systems Consulting.** The consulting arm of the Fortisyn Group — and the primary revenue engine. This is where the money comes in right now, funding the group's other ventures.

**URL:** [innovatience.ca](https://innovatience.ca)

## Services

Innovatience delivers technical systems consulting across:

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Software Development** | Custom applications (Node.js stack), accounting systems |
| **Infrastructure Design** | Network topology, lab environments, systems architecture |
| **Web Presence** | Corporate websites, digital identity |

## Key Client

### AES Engineering
The firm's primary client. AES Engineering is an electrical, lighting & technology consulting engineering firm — the core of Innovatience's current business and the main source of revenue that funds the broader Fortisyn Group. (Industrial buildings are one of many sectors AES serves, not its discipline.)
