# Gap Priorities

Running list of knowledge gaps identified but not yet filled. Updated by Knowledge Scout after each run. Prevents re-researching the same gaps.

## Unresearched (priority order)

*All 14 original gaps + the 2026-06-13 lint recommendations resolved. New gaps below as the vault grows.*

| Priority | Gap | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Med | 30 uncataloged root-level ChatGPT conversations | `chatgpt-conversations/*.md` (root, not under an entity subdir) — e.g. `book-setup-on-kdp`, `jungle-meditation`, `mindtechart---website`, `corporate-structure-with-trust`, `costa-rica-book-promo`, `influencer:-siena-wilder`, `roy.md`. They're documented by title in [[40-Resources/chatgpt-conversation-index\|chatgpt-conversation-index]] but not filed into entity subdirs like the other 85. **Navigation/filing gap, not research** — handle in a lint/filing pass (move to `chatgpt-conversations/<entity>/`). Moving 30 files autonomously is a destructive-ish gate; defer to a run with human present or a dedicated filing task. |
| Med | Costa Rica specifics needing Roy's input | New page [[40-Resources/costa-rica\|Costa Rica]] is synthesized from general 2026 guides. Confirm: which entity (S.R.L. vs S.A.) Costa Rica ops use; La Dolce Niente fiber availability; current residency/visa status; how Fortisyn/Aurora Legacy bank locally given holding-company banking caveat. Human-input gap, not web research. |
| Low | NotebookLM auth dead 7 cron runs | `No cookies found` on 2026-06-15, -16, -17, -19, -20, -21, -22 — **still down as of scout #14 (2026-09-07, ~2.5 months)**. Needs `npx oneclicklm login` re-run by Roy (interactive). Until then, web tools are the primary cron research path (skill prerequisite updated). Now documented on the new [[40-Resources/notebooklm\|NotebookLM]] page. |
| Low | AES Engineering firm identity confirmation | Vault-wide wording now "electrical, lighting & technology consulting engineering" (scout #14 fixed the Innovatience hub + status report). **Final confirmation still pending Roy** — see ⚠️ on the AES page. |
| Low | Agent-run vocabulary cluster | "Agent Run", "Run Log", "Decision Gates" (gates/lock/tools/run-agent) used across 30-Automations + 90-System runtime with no concept page defining the vocabulary. Connects [[40-Resources/agentic-orchestration\|Agentic Orchestration]]. |
| Low | soleriatechnology-com.md stub enrichment | Page exists ("12-route React SPA, most complex in Fortisyn portfolio") but is stub-level. Enrich from `/home/projects/soleriatechnology` + conversations. |
| Low | Folder-style wikilinks | e.g. `[[chatgpt-conversations/hudlin-services/]]` — folder-style links in prose; replace with page links where a page exists, else keep as folder refs. Lint/filing pass. |
| Low | 16 stale May pages | Lint rec #4 — archive or refresh. Lint job, not scout research. |
