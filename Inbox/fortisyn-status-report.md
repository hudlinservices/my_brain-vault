# Fortisyn Corporate Umbrella — Status Report

> ⚠️ **Superseded (2026-09-07).** This is a 2026-05-19 snapshot. Current authority is [[10-Projects/Corporate-Registry|Corporate Registry]]: **11 entities + 1 external client (AES Engineering)** — not 12. Since this report: Jungle Media → [[10-Projects/auronmedia/_corporate-hub|Auron Media]], Versa Retail → [[10-Projects/mercovaretail/_corporate-hub|Mercova Retail]], and AES is an electrical/lighting/technology consulting firm, not "industrial engineering."

## 3. Active Code vs Empty Shells

This section evaluates whether the project has actual source code on disk beyond just the vault markdown files.

### ✅ Projects WITH Active Code (code repositories confirmed on disk)

| Project | Entity | Path | Evidence |
|---------|--------|------|----------|
| **Chat Assistant** | Python Slayers | `/home/projects/pythonslayers/chat_assistant/` | backend/, frontend/, deploy/ directories confirmed |
| **Fortisyn Vault** *(this vault)* | Python Slayers | `/home/projects/pythonslayers/fortisyn-vault/` | Active Obsidian vault — this system |
| **Spanish Tutor** | Python Slayers | `/home/projects/pythonslayers/spanish_tutor/` | backend/, frontend/, data/, specs/ directories confirmed |
| **Chart of Accounts Pro** | Innovatience | `/home/projects/innovatience/accounting/` | dist/, public/, src/, tests/, uploads/ directories confirmed; Node.js project |
| **PMO Setup** | AES Engineering | `/home/projects/aesengineering/pmo-setup/` | docs/, flows/, memory/, powerbi/, scripts/ directories confirmed |
| **Limited Edition Intro** | Jungle Media | `/home/projects/junglemedia/limited-edition-intro/` | .hyperframes/ and audio/ directories confirmed |
| **Jungle Meditation** | Versa Retail | `/home/projects/versaretail/junglemeditation/` | Django project — core/, jm_config/, data/, media/, static/, templates/ |
| **Jungle Wear** | Versa Retail | `/home/projects/versaretail/junglewear/` | Django project — core/, jw_config/, data/, media/, static/, templates/ |
| **Roy Hudlin Store** | Versa Retail | `/home/projects/versaretail/royhudlin/` | Django project — core/, roy_config/, data/, logs/, media/, static/, templates/ |
| **Versa Admin** | Versa Retail | `/home/projects/versaretail/versa-admin/` | Django project — core/, corp_config/, data/, staticfiles/, templates/ |
| **Versa API** | Versa Retail | `/home/projects/versaretail/versa-api/` | Django REST Framework project — core/, api_config/, data/, staticfiles/, templates/ |
| **Versa Store** | Versa Retail | `/home/projects/versaretail/versa-store/` | Django project — core/, store_config/, data/, staticfiles/, templates/ |
| **royhudlin.com** | Roy Hudlin | `/home/projects/royhudlin/websites/royhudlin.com/` | backend/, frontend/, image-extract/ directories confirmed |

### ⚠️ Projects That May Be Empty Shells (no code directory OR no project file)

| Project | Entity | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Innovatience Website** | Innovatience | Hub notes say "directory exists but needs population — currently empty" |
| **Signatures** | Jungle Media | Hub notes say "directory exists but contents need review" |
| **Home Automation** | Soleria Technology | No dedicated project markdown file; mentioned in corporate hub but no path or status |
| **soleriatechnology.com** | Soleria Technology | Referenced in hub; no project file found |
| **junglemeditation.com** | Versa Retail / Websites | Referenced in Jungle Meditation project; no project file found |

### 🔲 Entities With No Projects in Filesystem

| Entity | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aurora Legacy** | Trust administration likely handled externally (legal/financial) |
| **Hudlin Services** | IT infrastructure managed directly on servers/cloud |
| **La Dolce Niente** | Property ownership entity — no code projects needed |
| **Literary Imprint** | Publishing operations likely managed externally |

## 4. Recommendations

### 🔴 High Priority — Needs Immediate Attention

1. **Create the Websites corporate hub file** — `10-Projects/websites/_corporate-hub.md` does not exist. Multiple projects (soleriatechnology.com, junglemeditation.com) reference this entity. Without a hub, these projects are untracked orphans.

2. **Build project files for Soleria Technology** — Home automation dev and soleriatechnology.com are referenced in the hub but have no project markdown files. They cannot be tracked, delegated, or reported on.

3. **Evaluate Innovatience Website** — The code directory is empty. If this is needed as a public web presence for the consulting revenue engine, it needs staffing. If deprioritized, mark as such.

### 🟡 Medium Priority — Needs Attention Soon

4. **Review Jungle Media Signatures** — The directory "exists but contents need review." Classify as active or archived.

5. **Create project files for referenced website projects** — `soleriatechnology.com` and `junglemeditation.com` have no standalone project files. If they're active, create them. If deprecated, archive formally.

6. **Add Hudlin Services to active tracking** — As the IT backbone for all entities, even if infrastructure is managed directly, a project hub tracking services, uptime, and connectivity would improve visibility.

### 🟢 Low Priority — Nice to Have

7. **Aurora Legacy & Literary Imprint project templates** — If any aspect of trust administration or publishing is managed digitally (document tracking, rights management), consider creating lightweight project files.

8. **Standardized project metadata** — A few projects have incomplete metadata (missing goals, empty task lists). Consider a sweep to ensure every project has: purpose, at least one goal, and a status.

## Update: 2026-05-19 — Second Audit (Marketing Agent)

A second survey was conducted on 2026-05-19. The findings above from the first audit are largely confirmed. Key additional findings:

### Additional Findings from This Audit

1. **Roy Hudlin entity found** — Not listed as a subsidiary in the Fortisyn hub, but has a corporate hub at `10-Projects/royhudlin/_corporate-hub.md`. This is a personal brand entity (author of 5 books by Literary Imprint, social media, thought leadership). Has 1 active project: royhudlin.com.

2. **Websites entity confirmed missing** — The Fortisyn hub links to `[[10-Projects/websites/_corporate-hub|Websites]]` but no file exists at that path. 2 projects (soleriatechnology.com, junglemeditation.com) reference it and have no project files.

3. **12 total entities confirmed** — Including Roy Hudlin (personal brand), that makes 12 entities in scope (11 subsidiaries + 1 client).

4. **2 empty-shell projects confirmed**:
   - Innovatience Website — directory exists, empty
   - Signatures (Jungle Media) — directory exists, needs review

5. **2 missing project files**:
   - soleriatechnology.com — referenced from Soleria Technology hub, no file
   - junglemeditation.com — referenced from Jungle Meditation project, no file

### Updated Recommendations

Same as above with these additions:
- **Add Roy Hudlin to Fortisyn hub** — the `_corporate-hub.md` for Fortisyn lists 11 subsidiaries but doesn't include Roy Hudlin
- **Prioritize website project files** — both soleriatechnology.com and junglemeditation.com lack project tracking entirely
