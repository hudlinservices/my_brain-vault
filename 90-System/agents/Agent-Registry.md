# Agent Registry

How the runtime executes these agents — the loop, the three-gate model, locking, and resumable run logs — is documented in [[40-Resources/agentic-orchestration|Agentic Orchestration & Agent Runtime]].

## Active Agents

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link AS "Agent",
  description AS "Description",
  domains AS "Domains",
  model_preference AS "Model",
  version AS "Version"
FROM "90-System/agents"
WHERE tags INCLUDES "agent-definition" AND status != "dormant"
SORT file.name ASC
```

Active: [[90-System/agents/auron-agent|Auron Agent]], [[90-System/agents/content-agent|Content Agent]], [[90-System/agents/knowledge-scout-agent|Knowledge Scout Agent]], [[90-System/agents/marketing-agent|Marketing Agent]]

## Dormant Agents

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link AS "Agent",
  description AS "Description"
FROM "90-System/agents"
WHERE tags INCLUDES "agent-definition" AND status = "dormant"
SORT file.name ASC
```

Dormant: [[90-System/agents/social-media-agent|Social Media Agent]] — superseded by Auron Agent (2026-06-15); kept as historical MindTechArt voice spec.

## Agents by Domain

```

## Agents Awaiting Decisions

```dataview

  delegated_outcome AS "Task"
FROM "30-Automations/logs"

```

## Quick Launch

To delegate to an agent, use the command palette or run from terminal:

```bash
# Content Agent
node 90-System/agents/run-agent.js \
  --agent-def "90-System/agents/content-agent.md" \
  --outcome "Create and publish this week's newsletter about topic X" \
  --project "10-Projects/my-project.md"

# Marketing Agent  
node 90-System/agents/run-agent.js \
  --agent-def "90-System/agents/marketing-agent.md" \
  --outcome "Plan social media campaign for product launch" \
  --project "10-Projects/my-project.md"

# Resume an agent awaiting decision
node 90-System/agents/run-agent.js \
  --agent-def "90-System/agents/content-agent.md" \
  --resume --run-log "30-Automations/logs/2026-05-18-content-agent-newsletter.md"
```
