Append-only chronological record of everything that happens in this wiki — ingests, queries, lint passes, merges, and structural changes. Parseable with `grep "^## \[" log.md | tail -5`.

## [2026-06-22] scout | Thirteenth run (autonomous cron) — the "monetization" trilogy: Digital Publishing (KDP), E-Commerce & White-Label Retail, Accounting & Multi-Entity Finance

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. Same dry-queue state as runs #8–#12: the gap registry holds only Low/Med items needing Roy (Costa Rica specifics, AES identity, "industrial engineering" label, NotebookLM re-auth) or filing/lint jobs (30 uncataloged root ChatGPT files, 16 stale May pages). Swept the vault directly per the standing protocol: uncataloged-page sweep first (none found; lint-2026-06-15 remains the latest and is cataloged), then a recurring-term frequency sweep (excluding meta files), then a concept-existence check.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
The backbone-cluster pattern is now SIX runs deep (#8 brand/career, #9 tech-infra, #10 corporate/agentic, #11 workbench, #12 Art-pillar) — and the recurring-term sweep surfaced the last untouched backbone: **how Fortisyn makes money.** The vault has documented how it *builds*, *runs*, is *structured*, and what it's *about* — but never the **monetization layer**. The single highest-frequency *undocumented* term in the whole vault is **`ebook` (34 pages)**; `publishing` (15), `e-commerce` (9), `merchandise` (8), `accounting` (6), `tax` (7) all sit unfilled, and the Fortisyn hub literally names a "content-to-commerce pipeline" that no page defines. A concept-existence check confirmed **zero** pages for publishing, commerce, or finance.

The cluster split into the now-standard three interlocking pages (two interlock + one high-connectivity standalone):
1. **Digital Publishing & Self-Publishing (KDP)** (highest compound value, `ebook`=34) — the *books* arm; KDP 2026 royalty tiers (ebook 70%/35% + $0.15/MB delivery fee, print 60%/40% expanded, KU exclusivity), three POD formats, ISBN/publisher-of-record. The Literary Imprint domain, grounded in Roy's own [[chatgpt-conversations/book-setup-on-kdp|KDP setup conversation]].
2. **E-Commerce & White-Label Retail** — the *merch* arm; white-label print-on-demand, multi-tenant storefronts, the 2026 POD landscape (Printful/Sellfy/Fourthwall), payment processing. The Mercova Retail domain, grounded in the [[40-Resources/django-platform-architecture|Django triad]].
3. **Accounting, Bookkeeping & Multi-Entity Finance** (high-connectivity standalone) — the finance layer beneath all 11 entities; chart of accounts, Canadian SBD *sharing* among associated CCPCs (s.125(3)), the passive-income grind, intercompany dividends/loans/management-fees, 2026's new Form T2SCH23A, and Roy's Canada/Costa-Rica dual-residency tax position. Grounded in the 7-file [[chatgpt-conversations/innovatience/|Innovatience finance corpus]].

#1 and #2 interlock (the two arms of the content-to-commerce pipeline — books-as-products vs merch-as-products, both POD/produce-on-order; Auron creates → Literary/Mercova sell). #3 is the standalone where *all* revenue lands, tying to the [[40-Resources/holding-company-trust-structure|holding/trust]] firewall and [[40-Resources/costa-rica|Costa Rica]] tax. Together they document the "how Fortisyn monetizes" layer.

**Bonus stale-fix (new-concept-anchors-a-stale-page strategy):** [[10-Projects/innovatience/accounting|Chart of Accounts Pro]] was a thin 2026-05-18 stub (lint-flagged stale). The new finance page gave it something authoritative to anchor to — added a "What It Implements" section + Research Notes, bumped `updated` to 2026-06-22.

**⚠️ Tooling deviation (SEVENTH consecutive cron failure):** NotebookLM auth unavailable again (`No cookies found`) — now -15/-16/-17/-19/-20/-21/-22. Prompt named NotebookLM so I spot-checked `notebook_list` once (instant failure, zero cost), then proceeded on web tools as primary. All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter + per-page `## Sources` lists.

**Pages created:**
- [[40-Resources/digital-publishing-self-publishing|Digital Publishing & Self-Publishing (KDP)]] — three formats, 2026 KDP royalty math (ebook 70%/35% + delivery fee, print 60%/40%, KU 90-day exclusivity + ~$0.0045/page), ISBN/publisher-of-record, Literary Imprint DIY/DFY mapping.
- [[40-Resources/ecommerce-white-label-retail|E-Commerce & White-Label Retail]] — white-label = brand's face/Mercova's engine, POD zero-inventory, the four-way 2026 POD landscape, multi-tenant payment/storefront mechanics, the Fortisyn storefronts (Jungle Wear, Roy Hudlin Store, Jungle Meditation).
- [[40-Resources/accounting-multi-entity-finance|Accounting, Bookkeeping & Multi-Entity Finance]] — chart of accounts, SBD sharing + passive-income grind + intercompany (CRA), salary-vs-dividend, GST/payroll, T2SCH23A (2026), Costa Rica dual-residency layer; the high-connectivity revenue hub. ⚠️ dual-residency tax flagged as open-for-Roy.

**Enriched / cross-linked:** Literary Imprint hub (new "How the Publishing Works" section), Mercova hub (new "The Business Model" section), Chart of Accounts Pro (stale-fix + finance link), Fortisyn hub (content-to-commerce bullets → all 3 pages), holding-company-trust (finance link), Costa Rica (finance link), django-platform-architecture (e-commerce link), Roy Hudlin hub (KDP link on books), creative-work (publishing link). index.md, gap-priorities.md, knowledge-scout strategies updated.

## [2026-06-21] scout | Twelfth run (autonomous cron) — the "Art pillar" trilogy: Flow & Creativity, Photographic Poetry, Narrative Alchemy

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. Same dry-queue state as runs #8–#11: the gap registry holds only Low/Med items needing Roy (Costa Rica specifics, AES identity, "industrial engineering" label, NotebookLM re-auth) or filing/lint jobs (30 uncataloged root ChatGPT files, 16 stale May pages). So I swept the vault directly per the standing protocol: uncataloged-page sweep first (none found; lint-2026-06-15 remains the latest and is cataloged), then a recurring-term frequency sweep, then a concept-existence check.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
The recurring-term sweep surfaced the last untouched cluster — and this time the vault *told me what it was*. The [[40-Resources/mindtechart|MindTechArt]] page names three pillars: **Mind** (documented run #11 = mindfulness-meditation), **Tech** (documented runs #8–#11 = calm-technology + infra/workbench), and **Art** — which pointed only at a project page with no concept page. The same page explicitly names **Narrative Alchemy** as "the companion concept that binds the three pillars" while never defining it. And **flow** is the single most-referenced undocumented term in the whole vault (~30 pages, two dedicated export conversations, already flagged as "the bridge" in the meditation page). That is a pre-voted, self-identified gap cluster: the **"Art" pillar**, which completes the MindTechArt triad.

The cluster split into three interlocking pages (the predicted run-#11 shape — two interlock + one high-connectivity anchor):
1. **Flow & Creativity** (highest compound value, ~30 pages) — the *state*; Csíkszentmihályi's six characteristics + three conditions, and the hinge across all three pillars (Mind opens it, calm Tech protects it, Art lives in it). The anchor.
2. **Photographic Poetry** — the *visual form* of the Art pillar; photopoetry as a recognized genre (symbiosis, not illustration) grounded in Roy's actual aesthetic spec (green/gold palette, nature-only, the photo-poetry books).
3. **Narrative Alchemy** — the *verbal craft*; storytelling as the binding voice, grounded in Roy's documented communication style (no em dashes, stoic-but-emotional). Flagged the market's "brand alchemy" as the commercial cousin.

#2 and #3 interlock (the two forms of Roy's creative output — image and word); #1 is the standalone state both happen inside. Together they document the "Art" pillar — the last undocumented third of MindTechArt.

**⚠️ Tooling deviation (SIXTH consecutive cron failure):** NotebookLM auth unavailable again (`No cookies found`) — now -15/-16/-17/-19/-20/-21. The prompt named NotebookLM so I spot-checked `notebook_list` once (instant failure, zero cost) per the standing note, then proceeded on web tools as the primary path. All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter + per-page `## Sources` lists.

**Pages created:**
- [[40-Resources/flow-and-creativity|Flow & Creativity]] — Csíkszentmihályi flow (six characteristics, challenge-skill balance / clear goals / immediate feedback), autotelic creativity, and the Mind↔Tech↔Art hinge. Grounds the meditation page's existing "flow is the bridge" claim.
- [[40-Resources/photographic-poetry|Photographic Poetry (Photopoetry)]] — the genre (Facile/Pro Eto/Remains of Elmet), illustration-vs-symbiosis distinction, and Roy's systematic aesthetic spec + the three photo-poetry books.
- [[40-Resources/narrative-alchemy|Narrative Alchemy]] — storytelling-as-transformation, Roy's house voice as the alchemical medium, the per-pillar binding table, and the Literary Imprint / Auron Media application.

**Enriched / cross-linked:** MindTechArt (Art-pillar row → photopoetry, Narrative Alchemy linked, new flow paragraph + 3 Related links), mindfulness-meditation-practice (Flow section → flow page), creative-work (new "Related Concepts" section), Roy Hudlin hub (Brand section → all 3 pages, `updated` bumped). index.md, gap-priorities.md, knowledge-scout strategies updated.

## [2026-06-20] scout | Eleventh run (autonomous cron) — the "workbench" trilogy: Obsidian/PKM stack, Claude Code, Mindfulness & Meditation Practice

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. Same dry-queue state as runs #8–#10: the gap registry holds only Low/Med items that need Roy (Costa Rica specifics, AES identity, "industrial engineering" label, NotebookLM re-auth) or are filing/lint jobs (30 uncataloged root ChatGPT files, 16 stale May pages). So I swept the vault directly per the standing protocol: uncataloged-page sweep first (none found — lint-2026-06-15 is already cataloged and is the latest), then a recurring-term frequency sweep, then a concept-existence check.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
The recurring-term sweep again surfaced a themed *backbone* cluster (the pattern runs #8/#9/#10 established) — but this time the vault's own **workbench**: the tools Roy uses to *build and run* everything, named everywhere with no concept page.
- **Obsidian** (22 pages), **Dataview** (11), **Templater** (6) — the knowledge-management substrate.
- **Claude Code** (5), **DeepSeek** (7), **Anthropic** (3) — the AI-development substrate.
- **meditation** (18), **breathwork** (3) — the wellness/content practice domain, the one big undocumented half of the *business* (runs #9/#10 covered the tech/corporate halves).

These split into three pages, two interlocking + one standalone (the predicted shape):
1. **Obsidian & the Knowledge-Management Stack** (highest compound value, 22 pages) — the literal substrate every page lives in; local-first Markdown is *why* an LLM/Claude Code can read the vault at all. Grounded in CLAUDE.md tech stack + linking-guide + templates + 2026 PKM sources.
2. **Claude Code & AI-Assisted Development** — the tool actually executing this scout run; the *third leg* of the agentic trilogy (orchestration model → MCP integration → **the agent host itself**). Clarified the ⚠️ that two agent systems coexist (custom DeepSeek runtime vs Claude Code). Grounded in the export convos + 2026 Claude Code sources.
3. **Mindfulness & Meditation Practice** (high-connectivity standalone, 18 pages) — the practice domain behind Roy-as-teacher / Jungle Meditation / MindTechArt's "Mind" pillar; meditation vs breathwork vs flow, evidence-grounded. The wellness analogue to run #8's security-systems-consulting (career domain).

#1 and #2 interlock (Obsidian = where knowledge lives, Claude Code = how Roy acts on it — the two halves of the "agentic personal OS" workbench; Claude Code is also an MCP host and the agentic-orchestration runner). #3 is the standalone on the *content/wellness* side.

**Bonus stale-reference fix:** [[10-Projects/mercovaretail/junglemeditation|Jungle Meditation]] frontmatter was stale — `corporate_entity: Versa Retail`, `path: /home/projects/versaretail/`, `tags: versaretail`, and a "Jungle Media" link. Rewrote to Mercova Retail / `/home/projects/mercovaretail/` / Auron Media, bumped `updated`, and linked the new practice page. (Run-#10 strategy: a new concept page is the best anchor for fixing a stale page nearby.)

**⚠️ Tooling deviation (FIFTH consecutive cron failure):** NotebookLM auth unavailable again (`No cookies found`) — now 2026-06-15, -16, -17, -19, -20. The prompt named NotebookLM so I spot-checked `notebook_list` once (failed instantly, zero cost) per the run-#10 note, then proceeded on web tools as the primary path. All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter + per-page `## Sources` lists.

**Pages created:**
- [[40-Resources/obsidian-pkm-stack|Obsidian & the Knowledge-Management Stack]] — local-first/Markdown/bidirectional-links mapped to CLAUDE.md principles, the four-plugin stack, the Dataview-invisible-to-LLM caveat, 2026 agentic-PKM context.
- [[40-Resources/claude-code|Claude Code & AI-Assisted Development]] — agentic CLI, the third leg of the agent trilogy, MCP host, sub-agents/`/fork`, ⚠️ two-agent-systems clarification, where Roy uses it.
- [[40-Resources/mindfulness-meditation-practice|Mindfulness & Meditation Practice]] — meditation vs breathwork vs flow (evidence table), the flow→"Tech"-pillar bridge, Roy's "returning" teaching angle, vault threading.

**Enriched / cross-linked:** Jungle Meditation (stale fix + practice-page link), MindTechArt (practice-page link under "Mind"), agentic-orchestration + MCP (Claude Code links), my-brain project page (substrate links). index.md, gap-priorities.md, knowledge-scout strategies updated.

## [2026-06-19] scout | Tenth run (autonomous cron) — the "backbone" trilogy: Holding/Trust Structure, Model Context Protocol, Agentic Orchestration

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. Same as runs #8/#9: the gap registry held only Low/Med human-input + lint items (Costa Rica specifics, AES identity, "industrial engineering" label, 16 stale pages, the 30 uncataloged root ChatGPT files — all need Roy or are filing/lint jobs, not researchable). So I swept the vault directly: uncataloged-page sweep first (per the run-#9 strategy), then a recurring-term frequency sweep, then a concept-existence check.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
The recurring-term sweep surfaced high-frequency terms with **no concept page**: "holding company" (17 pages), "trust" (15), MCP (12), "agentic" (7) + the runtime `.js` files. These form a coherent **"backbone" trilogy** — the conceptual scaffolding the vault names everywhere but never documented, parallel to run #9's infrastructure trilogy but for *corporate/legal* and *agentic-OS* structure rather than tech infra:
1. **Holding Company & Trust Structure** (highest compound value) — every corporate hub + Corporate Registry + Costa Rica banking caveat reference the holding/trust setup, but no page explained the trust→holding→operating firewall. Grounded in Roy's own `chatgpt-conversations/corporate-structure-with-trust` (the naming brief: privacy/stability/strength, no "Hudlin"). Connects all 11 entities + Aurora Legacy + Fortisyn + Costa Rica.
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — OneClickLM is a *built, shippable* MCP server; the scout/agents reach NotebookLM/Obsidian/Buffer over MCP; no concept page. Connects OneClickLM ↔ all agents ↔ knowledge-scout ↔ tools.js.
3. **Agentic Orchestration & Agent Runtime** — CLAUDE.md principle #6 is implemented in ~5 `.js` files (run-agent/gates/tools/lock/run-log) with no concept page. Documented the loop, the three-gate model (creative/destructive/ambiguous), locking, resumable run logs (exit code 2 + `--resume`), and grounded it against 2026 HITL-orchestration practice + EU AI Act.

#2 and #3 interlock (MCP is *how* agents reach tools; the runtime is *what* orchestrates them with gates) — same interlocking-trilogy pattern as run #9. #1 is the high-connectivity standalone (corporate vs tech).

**Bonus stale-reference fix:** [[10-Projects/Corporate-Registry|Corporate Registry]] was stale (2026-05-18) — still listed "Jungle Media," "Versa Retail," and "12 entities." Rewrote the structure tree with current names (Auron Media, Mercova Retail), corrected to 11 entities + 1 external client, re-rooted it under Aurora Legacy (trust)→Fortisyn (holding), and linked the new concept page. High-value/low-effort per the stale-reference strategy.

**Navigation fix:** catalogued `Inbox/lint-2026-06-15.md` in index.md (third lint pass, was never added — same class of miss the run-#9 strategy warns about; uncataloged-page sweep caught it).

**⚠️ Tooling deviation (FOURTH consecutive cron failure):** NotebookLM auth unavailable again (`No cookies found`) — 2026-06-15, -16, -17, and now -19. Web tools remain the primary path (skill v2). All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter + per-page `## Sources` lists.

**Pages created:**
- [[40-Resources/holding-company-trust-structure|Holding Company & Trust Structure]] — two-layer risk/value split, trust ownership principle (irrevocable trust = can't be sued for what you don't own), the deliberate no-"Hudlin"/no-"Trust" naming, Fortisyn application diagram, Costa Rica banking link. ⚠️ revocable-trust-alone caveat flagged.
- [[40-Resources/model-context-protocol|Model Context Protocol (MCP)]] — Nov 2024 Anthropic standard, hosts/clients/servers, JSON-RPC, tools/resources/prompts; vault as both consumer (NotebookLM/Obsidian/Buffer) and producer (OneClickLM).
- [[40-Resources/agentic-orchestration|Agentic Orchestration & Agent Runtime]] — runtime file-by-file, the agent loop (DeepSeek/OpenAI-compatible), three-gate model, MAX_TURNS + locking + resumable run logs, all 6 agents, 2026 HITL/EU-AI-Act context.

**Enriched / cross-linked:** Aurora Legacy hub (Structure section + link), Fortisyn hub (asset-protection link), Corporate Registry (rewritten + link), OneClickLM (MCP resource link), Agent Registry (runtime link), Costa Rica (banking-caveat link). index.md, gap-priorities.md, knowledge-scout strategies updated.

## [2026-06-17] scout | Ninth run (autonomous cron) — infrastructure trilogy: Cloud Deployment, Network Architecture, Home Automation Stack

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. The gap registry held only "Low/Med" human-input items (Costa Rica specifics, AES identity confirmation, "industrial engineering" label, 16 stale pages — all need Roy or are lint jobs, not researchable). So I swept the vault directly per the run-#8 "queues are dry" protocol: a recurring-term sweep, an uncataloged-page sweep, and a broken-link check.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
The recurring-term sweep surfaced a cluster of *infrastructure* terms mentioned across project pages + ~40 ChatGPT-export conversations but with **no concept page**: Kubernetes (django-arch + Hudlin hub), Cloudflared, UniFi/Ubiquiti, Starlink, Plex, Home Assistant, Z-Wave. These split cleanly into three distinct, high-connectivity domains — a coherent "infrastructure trilogy":
1. **Cloud Deployment & Hosting** (highest compound value) — "Kubernetes clusters" was a one-line bullet on the Hudlin hub and a single row in django-platform-architecture with no explanation of *how*. Connects Hudlin Services ↔ Python Slayers ↔ Django architecture ↔ all Django/personal apps. Grounded in *Kubernetes Setup on DigitalOcean* (300-msg) + *Plex Cloudflared Tunnel Setup* conversations.
2. **Network Architecture (Ubiquiti/UniFi)** — also enriches the [[10-Projects/innovatience/lab-network|lab-network]] near-stub (literally a Ubiquiti project). Connects lab-network ↔ Hudlin ↔ Soleria ↔ Costa Rica. Grounded in *Starlink and Dream Wall setup* + UDM/AP conversations.
3. **Home Automation Stack** — Soleria's actual foundation (Home Assistant + Z-Wave), previously undocumented. Connects Soleria ↔ La Dolce Niente ↔ Costa Rica ↔ Hudlin. Grounded in *Home Assistant Z-Stick setup* conversation.

The three interlock: CGNAT on Starlink (Network) is *why* ingress uses Cloudflare Tunnel (Cloud); IoT devices (Home Automation) ride an isolated VLAN (Network).

A fourth finding — **30 uncataloged root-level `chatgpt-conversations/*.md` files** (not under entity subdirs) — is a *navigation/filing* gap, not research, so it was logged to gap-priorities for a future lint/filing pass rather than spending a max-3 research slot. Also fixed a stale index summary ("36 Auron Media conversations" → "36 across all 6 entities" — the conversation index always covered all entities).

**⚠️ Tooling deviation (THIRD consecutive cron failure):** NotebookLM auth unavailable again (`No cookies found`) — 2026-06-15, -16, and -17. Per the standing strategy note, this third failure triggers rewriting the skill's "NotebookLM MCP available" prerequisite to make WebSearch+WebFetch the *primary* research path for cron (done in this run's self-improve step). All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter + per-page `## Sources` lists.

**Pages created:**
- [[40-Resources/cloud-deployment-infrastructure|Cloud Deployment & Hosting Infrastructure]] — DOKS managed K8s (doctl/kubectl/helm, namespaces per entity, HPA), Cloudflare Tunnel (outbound-only, no open ports, works behind CGNAT, zero-trust, systemd), who-uses-it table.
- [[40-Resources/network-architecture|Network Architecture (Ubiquiti/UniFi)]] — UDM-Pro/Dream Wall, 802.1Q VLAN segmentation (security/perf/multi-tenancy), ui.com remote site adoption, Starlink WAN + CGNAT consequence.
- [[40-Resources/home-automation-stack|Home Automation Stack]] — Home Assistant local-control hub, Z-Wave JS + Z-Stick 10 Pro, 2026 protocol comparison (Z-Wave/Zigbee/Matter/Thread), IoT VLAN isolation, R&D-loop grounding, Matter portability bet.

**Enriched / cross-linked:** lab-network stub (Research Notes → Network Architecture); Hudlin Services hub (infra-stack bullets now link both concept pages + 2026 note); Soleria hub (new Technical Stack section + related links + note); django-platform-architecture (Hosting row links Cloud Deployment). index.md, gap-priorities.md, knowledge-scout strategies updated.

## [2026-06-16] scout | Eighth run (autonomous cron) — Costa Rica hub, MindTechArt concept, Security Systems Consulting concept

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. The gap registry had only "Low" items left (AES identity confirmation needs Roy; 16 stale pages are a lint job), and the 2026-06-13 lint recs were all resolved in the seventh run. So I scanned the vault directly: a broken-link sweep (all hits were directory/`.js`/template-placeholder false positives — no real broken-link gaps), an uncataloged-page sweep, and a recurring-term sweep for concepts mentioned everywhere but lacking a page.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
1. **Costa Rica** (highest compound value) — appears in 14+ pages (relocation destination, Soleria R&D testbed at La Dolce Niente, *Sloth Adventures* setting, "Costa Rica-ready" SFF LLM build, Auron social content) with **no dedicated page**. Genuine research warranted: digital nomad visa, territorial tax, corporate setup, fiber/connectivity, cost of living.
2. **MindTechArt** — Roy's core personal-brand framework (Mind + Tech + Art), referenced in 11+ pages, no concept page. Grounded the "Tech" pillar in the **calm-technology** design movement (Amber Case) to give the framework real backbone.
3. **Low-Voltage & Security Systems Consulting** — the actual technical domain behind Roy's 35-year career (ACS/IPVS/RTLS/CCTV, MasterFormat Div 27/28). Connects professional-history ↔ AES ↔ Innovatience ↔ lab-network with a shared concept instead of scattered acronyms.

A fourth gap — **5 uncataloged ChatGPT-import pages** (royhudlin/professional-history, creative-work, communication-style; innovatience/logo-and-brand; auronmedia/social-media-strategy) plus the uncataloged social-media-agent — was a navigation gap, not a research gap, so it was handled in the update step (index.md + hub backlinks) rather than counted against the max-3-gap guardrail.

**⚠️ Tooling deviation (same as 2026-06-15):** NotebookLM auth unavailable (`No cookies found` — cannot interactively re-login in cron). Fell back to WebSearch + WebFetch on authoritative 2026 sources. All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter and per-page `## Sources` lists.

**Pages created:**
- [[40-Resources/costa-rica|Costa Rica]] — DNV (~$3k/mo, territorial 0% foreign-income tax), S.A./S.R.L. setup + RTBF + holding-company banking caveat, fiber (50–200 Mbps, beach-town variability), cost of living (~$2–3k/mo). Flagged open questions for Roy.
- [[40-Resources/mindtechart|MindTechArt]] — three pillars mapped to vault evidence; grounded in calm technology (periphery, attention, Calm Tech Institute); brand application (audience, voice, channels, aesthetic).
- [[40-Resources/security-systems-consulting|Low-Voltage & Security Systems Consulting]] — MasterFormat Div 27/28 backbone, acronym glossary (ACS/IPVS/IDS/IPS/RTLS), consulting workflow (Procore bid mgmt, spec writing, master planning), Fortisyn revenue-engine connection.

**Cataloged + cross-linked (navigation):** added all 5 ChatGPT-import pages + social-media-agent to index.md; added backlinks from Roy Hudlin, Innovatience, and Auron Media hubs to the new concept pages and the import pages. Updated hub `updated` dates to 2026-06-16.

## [2026-06-15] scout | Seventh run (autonomous cron) — AES Engineering, social-media-automation skill, Social Media Marketing concept

Autonomous cron run — no human gate. Selected 3 gaps from the 2026-06-13 lint report's open recommendations and the broken-link scan.

**Gap selection rationale (recorded per autonomous-run protocol):**
1. **AES Engineering** (highest compound value) — referenced from 5+ live pages (Innovatience hub, Fortisyn hub, Corporate-Registry, status report) with **broken wikilinks** to `10-Projects/aesengineering/_corporate-hub`. Lint rec #1. Fixing it resolves dead links AND documents Fortisyn's only revenue source.
2. **social-media-automation skill** — the *active* Auron Agent's `allowed_skills` points to this non-existent page (broken link). Lint rec #2. Connects 6 brands + Buffer + marketing pages.
3. **Social Media Marketing concept page** — paired with #2 (shared research sources), completes the marketing concept set (copywriting/email/SEO/growth → +social). Links 4 existing marketing pages + Auron Agent.
Lint rec #3 (specs/ cataloging) was dropped — the `specs/` directory no longer exists.

**⚠️ Tooling deviation:** NotebookLM auth was unavailable (`No cookies found` — cannot interactively re-login in cron). Fell back to WebSearch + WebFetch on authoritative sources (aesengr.com, Wikipedia, Buffer/Sprout Social). All findings attributed via `source:` frontmatter.

**Pages created:**
- [[10-Projects/aesengineering/_corporate-hub|AES Engineering]] — AES Engineering Ltd (aesengr.com): electrical/lighting/technology consulting engineering, founded 2001, ~150 staff, Vancouver BC + Alberta. Documented services, sectors, the Innovatience engagement (PMO Setup), and revenue-engine role. **Flagged contradiction:** vault calls AES "industrial engineering" but the firm is electrical/technology — left existing claims intact with a ⚠️ callout for Roy to confirm.
- [[20-Skills/marketing/social-media-automation|Social Media Automation]] — execution skill behind the Auron Agent: vault content → Buffer queue → human approval gate → publish + log. 2026 automation best practices (automate posting not relationships, ML best-time, AI-assist/human-approve).
- [[40-Resources/marketing/social-media-marketing|Social Media Marketing]] — fifth marketing pillar: platforms, planned vs unplanned, paid vs organic, KPIs, connections to email/SEO/copywriting/growth.

**Bonus fix:** corrected stale `junglemedia` → `auronmedia` wikilink in `growth-hacking.md`.

**Broken links resolved:** Innovatience hub, Fortisyn hub, and Auron Agent now point to existing pages.

## [2026-06-13] ingest | Marketing knowledge base — 10 sources from Vault Ingest notebook

First batch ingest from Vault Ingest notebook. 10 marketing sources processed via NotebookLM:

- **Copywriting** — PAS and AIDA formulas, benefits over features, swipe files. Connected to Auron Media, Mercova, Literary Imprint, Roy Hudlin
- **Email Marketing** — 3,600% ROI, 5 email types, CAN-SPAM compliance, organic list building. Fortisyn applications per entity
- **SEO Fundamentals** — Crawl/index/rank, long-tail keywords, relevance + authority. Every Fortisyn website mapped
- **Growth Hacking** — Test fast/scale what works, UGC, partnerships, data-driven virality. Entity-specific tactics

Total: 4 concept pages at `40-Resources/marketing/`, 10 sources logged in `ingest-log.md`

## [2026-06-13] scout | Sixth run — SLF for ROY page, stub enrichment, lint pass

**SLF for ROY project page created:**
- AI-powered personal companion (tutor, coach, assistant, mentor)
- Django + React PWA at /home/personal/slf/
- Linked to Chat Assistant, Spanish Tutor, Fortisyn Vault vault

**Chat Assistant + Spanish Tutor enriched:**
- Updated paths to /home/personal/ (moved from /home/projects/)
- Added tech stacks, features, and cross-references to SLF for ROY
- Both now reflect the personal projects ecosystem (chat-assistant, spanish-tutor, slf)

**Second lint pass:**
- 16 stale pages cataloged, 2 missing pages identified (AES Engineering, social-media-automation skill)
- specs/ directory discovered — personal-os-infra spec kit output, not yet cataloged
- Report filed at [[Inbox/lint-2026-06-13]]

## [2026-06-13] project | chat-assistant + spanish-tutor moved to /home/personal/ — personal projects, not company-client work

## [2026-06-13] project | SLF for ROY initialized — AI-powered personal companion chatbot, Django + React PWA

## [2026-06-13] scout | Fifth run — Hyperframes concept, Django architecture, daily notes, /new-project skill

Researched 3 gaps and built a new skill:

## [2026-06-12] scout | Fourth run — Mercova architecture, Limited Edition Intro, directory renames

Researched and corrected 3 gaps:

**Versa → Mercova stale references corrected:**
- Rewrote versa-admin.md, versa-api.md, versa-store.md with Mercova branding

All 14 original gaps now resolved. Gap registry cleared.

## [2026-06-09] lint | First lint pass

Full wiki health check. Fixed: 7 pages missing frontmatter (README, test-run, music-library-missing, lab-network, linking-guide, search-config, Skill-Registry), 4 agent run logs, 2 broken links in lab-network, zero inbound links to new concept pages (added cross-refs from llm_wiki.md), stale path reference in pythonslayers corporate hub. Noted: 27 stale pages from May 18-24, thin project content, Dataview dependency for external LLM readability, no daily notes since May 26, agent dormancy since May 19. Report filed at [[Inbox/lint-2026-06-09]].

## [2026-06-09] ingest | LLM Wiki Methodology

First ingest into the vault. Processed `raw/2026-06-09 - LLM Wiki Methodology.md` and extracted 4 concept pages:
- [[40-Resources/rag-vs-wiki|RAG vs Wiki Knowledge]] — comparison of retrieval vs compounding approaches
- [[40-Resources/three-layer-architecture|Three-Layer Architecture]] — raw sources → wiki → schema explained
- [[40-Resources/wiki-operations|Wiki Operations]] — ingest, query, lint workflows
- [[40-Resources/index-log-pattern|Index and Log Pattern]] — how index.md and log.md drive navigation

Also created `raw/` directory with README, rewrote `CLAUDE.md` as full schema with workflow documentation, and updated `index.md` with all new pages.

## [2026-06-09] merge | Vault consolidation from pythonslayers/fortisyn-vault

Merged `/home/projects/pythonslayers/fortisyn-vault/` into this vault. Actions:
- Copied 21 unique project pages into correct `10-Projects/<org>/` subdirectories
- Overwrote 6 files with newer versions from source (Home.md, plan.md, agent templates)
- Merged 8 duplicate Title-Case/kebab-case project pages — deleted auto-generated stubs
- Copied non-markdown assets: dashboard scripts, agent JS runtime, logos, templates
- Added `llm_wiki.md` to `40-Resources/` — methodology reference
- Created `index.md` — comprehensive page catalog organized by category
- Created `log.md` — this file
- Deleted source vault `/home/projects/pythonslayers/fortisyn-vault/`
- Committed everything as initial git commit `a708f29`

## [2026-05-26] auto | Dashboard sync — project stubs registered

Dashboard auto-sync registered 5 aesengineering project stubs (360-Camera-Info, Building-Intercom-Systems, Granville-Loops-Ess, Parkade-Entrance, Pmo-Setup) and several others across pythonslayers, versaretail, innovatience, and royhudlin. These were thin auto-generated placeholders — aesengineering stubs were duplicates of real pages in the AES Knowledge Base vault and were removed.

## [2026-05-19] agent | Marketing Agent — Fortisyn entity survey

Marketing Agent surveyed all corporate entities across the Fortisyn umbrella and produced `Inbox/fortisyn-status-report.md`. First agent-driven cross-entity analysis.

## [2026-05-19] agent | Content Agent — runtime test

Content Agent successfully created test files at `Inbox/test-run.md` — verified agent runtime works with DeepSeek.

## [2026-05-18] setup | Vault infrastructure initialized

Initial vault scaffolding created:
- Directory structure: 00-Dashboard, 10-Projects, 20-Skills, 30-Automations, 40-Resources, 90-System, Inbox
- 4 Obsidian plugins installed: Templater, Dataview, QuickAdd, Shell Commands
- 2 agents defined: Content Agent, Marketing Agent
- Corporate alignment started — mapping all Fortisyn entities
- 57 tasks completed for initial infrastructure
- Git repository initialized

## [2026-09-01] project | Corporate Governance — bank package finalized

Bank package for the three BC companies finalized and committed (`corporate-governance/`,
main, 3f16f01). 12 final US Letter PDFs in `bank-package/`, one per document, each company
in its own brand colours and colour logo; resolutions and the share transfer render in the
official framed certificate-style layout. Innovatience certificate C-001 recorded as issued
at incorporation (2025-09-03) and cancelled on the 2026-06-25 transfer. Ownership chain
confirmed by Roy: Roy → Fortisyn Holdings (200 Class A Common) → Innovatience + Mercova;
Mercova subscribed directly by Fortisyn, no Roy involvement. New page:
[[10-Projects/corporate-governance|Corporate Governance]].

## [2026-09-01] project | Corporate Governance — Vancity banking resolutions + renamed print set

Banking resolutions added for the Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (Vancity) business
accounts of Fortisyn Holdings Ltd. and Mercova Retail Ltd. — each rendered as a final framed
US Letter PDF (`Fortisyn Banking Resolution - Vancity.pdf`,
`Mercova Banking Resolution - Vancity.pdf`); Roy Hudlin appointed authorized signing officer,
signing authority drafted as any one signatory (confirm against Vancity). The print set now
holds 15 PDFs, renamed throughout to Roy's `{Company} {Document}.pdf` scheme; generators and
verifier updated to the new names; a blank Innovatience C-002 certificate PDF (broken Firefox
print) was replaced with a clean render. Updated:
[[10-Projects/corporate-governance|Corporate Governance]].

## [2026-09-01] project | Corporate Governance — sequential resolution numbering + final renames

All directors' resolutions are now numbered sequentially per company: Fortisyn Nos. 1–3
(subscriber's shares, s. 85 consideration, Vancity banking), Mercova Nos. 1–2 (share
issuance, Vancity banking), Innovatience No. 1 (transfer approval). Roy's latest file renames
adopted in the generators and verifier: `Fortisyn Directors Resolution - Vancity Bank
Account.pdf`, `Mercova Directors Resolution - Vancity Bank Account.pdf`,
`Innovatience Share transfer to Fortisyn.pdf`. Full verification passes 15/15 with no
extras. Updated: [[10-Projects/corporate-governance|Corporate Governance]].

## [2026-09-01] project | Cluster remediation — junglemeditation.com assets restored

The junglemeditation.com homepage rendered unstyled: every asset URL
(auron.hyperspeedfiles.com → DO Spaces bucket `auron`) returned 403. Root cause: the
bucket was empty — `list_objects_v2` showed 0 objects under the site's prefix and
`style.css` was NoSuchKey. The pod's baked local copy (/usr/share/nginx/html, 241 MB) was
the surviving full set. Fix: re-uploaded 618 objects (cs/js/im/media/new/assets → the
junglemeditation/static/ and junglemeditation/media/ prefixes, media mirrored to the
doubled media/media/ prefix) with public-read ACLs using the app's own credentials inside
the pod — no app or image changes. Verification: 46/52 homepage asset URLs return 200
with correct content types. Remaining gaps (unrecoverable — existed only in the wiped
bucket): 3 article-card webp images and 2 slider backgrounds (100x50_exp_bg3/bg4). Flags:
other Spaces buckets (mercova, fortisyn, slayers, hud-prod, versa, hudcdn) also deny
anonymous reads and may be wiped; junglewearclothing.com serves its own assets and is
unaffected; an SMTP password is present in the junglemeditation pod environment (advise
rotation); hardening option: rebuild the image to self-host static via the pod's nginx
(/cs/ /js/ /im/ /media/ locations already exist) to drop the bucket dependency.

## [2026-07-12] maintenance | React frontend patterns + cleanup (backfilled 2026-09-07)

Created [[40-Resources/react-frontend-patterns|React Frontend Patterns]]; deleted 4 stub pages; fixed 4 broken links; updated index.md. This work was committed (c875002) but never logged at the time — found by scout #14's unlogged-work sweep.

## [2026-09-07] infra | DO registry repair sweep (session HUD-KUBE)

Registry-wide audit + repair: 21 repos, every tag now resolves as a single image manifest. Three ImagePull gaps fixed — fortisyn-website now pinned by tag `:5.0.1`, royhudlin prod 5.0.13 → `:5.0.17`, junglemeditation 1.0.1 → `:5.0.12` (stale `command` override removed; image self-boots via `/entrypoint.sh`). Legacy `meditation` + `jungle-wear` repos deleted on Roy's word. Policy recorded in global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Filed into [[40-Resources/cloud-deployment-infrastructure|Cloud Deployment & Hosting Infrastructure]] and [[10-Projects/mercovaretail/website/junglemeditation-com|junglemeditation.com]].

## [2026-09-07] scout | Gap sweep #14 (session GOD MODE)

Four gaps approved by Roy. NotebookLM auth still dead — research ran as vault-grounded synthesis (conversation files, skill registries, global CLAUDE.md) per the 2026-06-16 strategy.

- **Contradiction & status sweep (gap 3):** 12 files fixed — Versa Retail residue in [[10-Projects/mercovaretail/junglewear|Jungle Wear]], [[10-Projects/mercovaretail/royhudlin|Roy Hudlin Store]], [[10-Projects/mercovaretail/website/junglemeditation-com|junglemeditation.com]] frontmatter/tags → Mercova Retail; [[90-System/agents/social-media-agent|Social Media Agent]] marked dormant (superseded by Auron Agent) and [[90-System/agents/Agent-Registry|Agent Registry]] dataview now excludes dormant; [[20-Skills/Skill-Registry|Skill Registry]] phantom `20-Skills/design` + `video` sections removed; [[10-Projects/innovatience/_corporate-hub|Innovatience hub]] "industrial engineering" → electrical/lighting/technology consulting; [[10-Projects/innovatience/website|website.md]] broken `[[startup.md]]`/`[[memory.md]]` links → plain text; [[Inbox/fortisyn-status-report|Status Report]] superseded banner; [[40-Resources/chatgpt-conversation-index|Conversation Index]] real inventory (116 files: 86 filed + 30 root pending); [[40-Resources/unified-knowledge-graph|Unified Graph]] stats refreshed; knowledge-scout.md auth contradiction (3 vs 7 failed crons) fixed; index.md stats corrected (5 agents, 5 templates, 3 daily notes).
- **DO Spaces/CDN + incident filing (gap 2):** [[40-Resources/cloud-deployment-infrastructure|Cloud Deployment]] gained the "Static Assets — DigitalOcean Spaces" section (bucket inventory, 2026-09-01 auron wipe: 618 objects restored / 5 unrecoverable, open items 🔴 SMTP rotation / 🟠 bucket audit / 🟡 nginx self-host) plus the 2026-09-07 registry repair record; junglemeditation-com.md enriched from stub (image `:5.0.12`, self-boot, both incidents). log.md backfilled: [2026-07-12] maintenance (unlogged commit c875002) and [2026-09-07] infra sweep.
- **Pi Fleet page (gap 1):** new [[10-Projects/hudlinservices/pi-fleet|Pi Fleet]] — 5-Pi inventory (plex1, plex2, sickchill, transmission, transmission2), **"t2" reconciled = transmission2**, Cloudflare Tunnel exposure (cockpit.hudlincloud.com ingress, tunnel `86b2db60-…`), Cockpit admin, daily crons (3:07 AM ingest / 4:13 AM scout), UDM-Pro/Starlink context. Cross-links: Hudlin hub, network-architecture, cloud-deployment, notebooklm, unified graph.
- **NotebookLM page (gap 4):** new [[40-Resources/notebooklm|NotebookLM]] — notebook/source/query model, Vault Ingest (`1ded6d40`) + persistent Knowledge Scout notebook, oneclicklm cookie auth, single-point-of-failure status (down since 2026-06-22, ~2.5 months). **Repair pending Roy:** run `npx oneclicklm login`, then verify `source_list("1ded6d40")` and bump [[90-System/ingest-log|Ingest Log]].

New gaps filed to gap-priorities.md: agent-run vocabulary cluster, soleriatechnology-com stub, folder-style wikilinks. Human-input items still open: AES identity confirmation, Costa Rica specifics, 30 root conversations filing.
